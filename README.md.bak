It is a simple android project. After open the app it will first show you the splash screen of the app. Then the recyclerview will be shown. There will be the list of data that has been added. There is a floating button. If someone clicks that button it will take him to the input fields where he/she can input the data value. The intent is doing this. If someone clicks the list from the main page it will take him to the next screen named user details. Here he/she can update the data or delete the data. I have used room database to store my data to the database.
